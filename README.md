My attempt at making an easy to build an initramFS Linux image for RISC-V testing.

**Prerequistes**
* A compatible riscv linux toolchain.

**Default Flow**

This builds an image using the default linux and busybox configurations
(`./linux_config`, `./busybox_config`). It auto-generates and initramfs.txt and
uses a dummy profile script.

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make

**Augmenting the image**

Set `./profile` to get what you need on bootup. Look at Makefile for how to change things.

Set `./initramfs.txt` to what you want (also auto-generated by build-initram.py).

Of course, you can always change the linux and busybox configurations.
