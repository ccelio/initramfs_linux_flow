My attempt at making an easy to build an initramFS Linux image for RISC-V testing.

Symbolic link points to initramfs.txt (arch/riscv/initramfs.txt).

Set "profile" to get what you need on bootup. Look at Makefile for how to change things.

Fedora RPMs is a CPIO, so just extract it.

dm-crypt, AES perf is heavy CPU in kernel.
"time make in a kernel tree which has not actually been modified".
something that modifies page-tables? lots of device I/O?
riscv-pk, ../configure --build=riscv64-unknown-linux, but look at patches that change uname to return riscv64.
