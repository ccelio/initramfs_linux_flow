My attempt at making an easy to build an initramFS Linux image for RISC-V testing.



**Setup:**

1. Please install the following in this directory:

    - busybox-1.21.1/
    - linux-4.6.2/
    - riscv-pk/

2. Change (arch/riscv/initramfs.txt) to be a symbolic link to point to $TOP/initramfs.txt.

   arch/riscv/initramfs.txt -> ../../../initramfs.txt    


**How to use:**

Set "profile" to get what you need on bootup. Look at Makefile for how to change things.
